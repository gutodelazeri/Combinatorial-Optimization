# Combinatorial Optimization

This is a collection of activities that I made in the context of INF05010, a combinatorial optimization course offered at UFRGS. [Here](https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~mrpritt/doku.php?id=inf05010:homepage) is the page of the course. An overview of each activitie is given below.

### Lab 1
Mathematical modeling of problems using linear constraints.  

### Lab 2
Mathematical modeling of problems using integer constraints.  

### Final Project
Mixed Integer Programming formulation of a problem and the development of a genetic algorithm to solve this problem.
