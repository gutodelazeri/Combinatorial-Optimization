# Combinatorial Optimization

This is a collection of projects I did in the context of INF05010, a combinatorial optimization course offered at UFRGS. [Here](https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~mrpritt/doku.php?id=inf05010:homepage) is the course page. An overview of each project is provided below.

### Lab 1
Mathematical modeling of problems using linear constraints.

### Lab 2
Mathematical modeling of problems using integer constraints.  

### Final Project
Mathematical modeling of a problem and a heuristic algorithm to solve this problem.
